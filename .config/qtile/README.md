# Qtile config written in Python.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

The code is not fully documented yet.  

It should however be easily useable by:
- making a backup of your `qtile` config, e.g. `mv ~/.config/qtile ~/.config/qtile.old`
- replacing with my config, e.g. `cp -r /path/to/my/dotfiles/.config/qtile ~/config/qtile`
- restarting `qtile`

`qtile` might not be fully functional right away:
- install `feh` and wallpapers at `~/repos/wallpapers/wallpapers` or edit `~/.config/qtile/scripts/qtile-autostart.sh` to suit your wallpapers and wallpaper manager.
- *coming soon*...
